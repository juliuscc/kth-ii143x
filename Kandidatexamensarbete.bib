abstract = {Research methods and methodologies are extremelyimportant when conducting research and degree projects. Theuse and application of the methods and methodologies areconsidered to be “necessarily vicious” and, unfortunately,often applied after the research has been conducted. The needfor applying methods before the actually research and thereasons for doing so are often stressed in the literature andcourses for research and scientific writing. This includes theaspects of selecting, understanding and applying researchmethods for a selected project. Unfortunately, it is difficult tochoose well-suited methods and too often the selected methodsand methodologies do not match each other. Instead, methodsare applied without knowing about the consequences theapplied method have both on the other chosen methods and onthe results of the work or research. This paper provides aportal of research methods and methodologies to help thestudents to choose and apply the most suitable methods byillustrating which methods belong together and thedistinctions between the different methods.},

@article{Liu2014,
abstract = {Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) have been very successful at managing structured data with well-defined schemas. Despite this, relational systems are generally not the first choice for management of data where schemas are not predefined or must be flexible in the face of variations and changes. Instead, No-SQL database systems supporting JSON are often selected to provide persistence to such applications. JSON is a light-weight and flexible semi-structured data format supporting constructs common in most programming languages. In this paper, we analyze the way in which requirements differ between management of relational data and management of JSON data. We present three architectural principles that facilitate a schemaless development style within an RDBMS so that RDBMS users can store, query, and index JSON data without requiring schemas. We show how these three principles can be applied to industry leading RDBMS platforms, such as the Oracle RDBMS Server, with relatively little effort. Consequently, an RDBMS can unify the management of both relational data and JSON data in one platform and use SQL with an embedded JSON path language as a single declarative language to query both relational data and JSON data. This SQL/JSON approach offers significant benefits to application developers as they can use one product to manage both relational data and semi-structured flexible schema data. {\textcopyright} 2014 ACM.},

@article{Brahmia2017a,
abstract = {TJSchema is a framework for the management of temporal documents stored in JSON format in a NoSQL database, similar to the tXSchema framework proposed for XML. In this work, we extend Schema to temporal schema versioning support. The proposed approach provides a systematic solution to the challenging task of evolving a JSON schema while maintaining all schema versions with their corresponding instances and, thus, guarantees the bookkeeping of a full history of both data and schemas. All components of a temporal JSON schema (i.e., conventional schema, temporal logical and physical characteristics) are allowed to vary over time to reflect changes in the real world and, thus, in application requirements. To this end, four sets of primitives for changing JSON schema components and their related JSON instance documents are introduced. The feasibility of our approach and the usage of the proposed primitives have been shown through a detailed and illustrative example.},
